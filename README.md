# DataCollector

This is a simple Java project using Spring Boot, MVC and RestFul Web Services.

This project demonstrates the way we can get data from disparate sources and populate it in a uniform format.

I have used only two disparate sources of data : CSV file and fake data.

Various URI endpoints are explained in the REST.md file.
